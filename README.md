# js-lucky-number
An integer is considered "lucky" in an array of integers (arr) if its frequency, or the number of times it appears in the array, is equal to its value. The task is to return the lucky integer in the array. If there are multiple lucky integers, the largest one should be returned. If there is no lucky integer, the function should return -1.
